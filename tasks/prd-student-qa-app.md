# Product Requirements Document: Student Q&A App

## Introduction/Overview

The Student Q&A App is a desktop web-based platform designed to help students post academic questions and receive reliable answers from teachers, peers, and subject matter experts (SMEs). The platform addresses the critical problem of students struggling to find trustworthy, timely answers to their academic questions outside of regular school hours.

The app focuses on the student experience, providing a streamlined interface for question submission, intelligent question analysis using LLM technology, and an organized dashboard for tracking question status and viewing answers.

## Goals

1. **Enable Seamless Question Submission**: Provide students with an intuitive interface to submit text-based academic questions with basic math notation support.

2. **Intelligent Question Processing**: Automatically analyze and categorize questions using LLM to extract metadata (subject, topic, difficulty level, grade level) for better expert matching.

3. **Enhanced Learning Experience**: Present students with similar previously answered questions to encourage self-learning and reduce duplicate submissions. **(Note: This feature is currently out of scope)**

4. **Efficient Question Management**: Provide students with a clean dashboard to track their question status and access answers.

5. **Achieve Market Fit**: Focus on high engagement, retention, and user satisfaction as early indicators of product-market fit.

## User Stories

1. **As a new student user**, I want to sign up using mobile OTP verification so that I can quickly access the platform without complex authentication.

2. **As a student**, I want to submit my academic question in a simple text box so that I can get help with my studies without friction.

3. **As a student**, I want the system to automatically analyze my question and categorize it properly so that experts can find and answer it efficiently. **(Note: Similar question suggestions are out of scope)**

4. **As a student**, I want to see my questions organized chronologically on my dashboard so that I can easily track what I've asked and when.

5. **As a student**, I want to clearly see which of my questions have been answered and which are still pending so that I can prioritize my learning.

6. **As a student**, I want to access answers to my questions in a clean, readable format so that I can understand the solutions provided by experts.
